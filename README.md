This project will allow you to separate your books into three categories

currently reading,

want to read,

and read.

You can click the downarrow on any of the books and move them to the appropriate desired category.

All the logic is done in javascript.
It uses ReactJS with ECMAscript 6 and above as it uses classes and methods vs functions.

It also calls APIs provided by Udacity to be able to retrieve the books that start out the website with
and it also calls APIs to perform searches

You can click the bottom right button of the page to perform searches for books based on author or title.
This calls the search apis, and returns up 20 results at once and will give you all the book covers, title, and author.
